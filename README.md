# HotBath

This is our submission for the hot bath problem for the Mathematical Contest in
modelling 2016.

We wrote a 3D simulation of a bath, and used that to determine the optimal
amount of hot water to pump into to keep it at an optimal temperature.

For more information read the pdf, hot_bath_paper.pdf.

It is the paper we submitted.
